Supervised Learning

**What is Supervised Learning?**

Supervised learning is a key branch of machine learning where models are trained on **labeled datasets**. Each training example consists of an input (features) and a correct output (label). The model learns a mapping from inputs to outputs, allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen data.

It’s widely applied in domains like:
- Email spam classification  
- Image recognition  
- Credit scoring  
- Sales forecasting  

Supervised learning algorithms fall into two major categories:
- **Classification** – predicting discrete labels (e.g., spam or not spam)  
- **Regression** – predicting continuous values (e.g., housing price)

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Input features** and **output labels** are used to train the model.
2. A **loss function** measures the prediction error.
3. The model adjusts its internal parameters (e.g., weights) to minimize the loss.
4. Evaluation is done on validation/test sets to measure generalization.
