# Supervised Learning
Supervised learning is a core branch of machine learning in which algorithms are trained on **labeled datasets**â€”datasets where each input is paired with a known and correct output. Each training example consists of an input vector (features) and an associated target value (label), enabling the algorithm to learn the functional relationship between inputs and outputs.

The primary goal of supervised learning is to generalize from the training data so that the model can make accurate predictions on previously unseen data. This process typically involves defining a loss function to measure the prediction error, optimizing the model parameters to minimize this error, and evaluating the model's performance on validation or test sets.

Supervised learning is widely used in both **classification** (where outputs are categorical, such as spam detection or image recognition) and **regression** (where outputs are continuous, such as predicting housing prices or stock values).

Its effectiveness depends on the quality and size of the labeled dataset, the complexity of the model, and the nature of the problem. With the right setup, supervised learning can deliver highly accurate and interpretable models that solve real-world problems across domains such as finance, healthcare, marketing, and natural language processing.
