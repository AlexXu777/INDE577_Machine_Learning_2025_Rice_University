Supervised Learning

1. What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a key branch of machine learning where models are trained on labeled datasets. 
Each training example consists of an input (features) and a correct output (label). 
The model learns a mapping from inputs to outputs, allowing it to make predictions on new, unseen data.

It’s widely applied in domains like:
- Email spam classification  
- Image recognition  
- Credit scoring  
- Sales forecasting  

Supervised learning algorithms fall into two major categories:
- Classification – predicting discrete labels (e.g., spam or not spam)  
- Regression – predicting continuous values (e.g., housing price)


2. How It Works?

1. Input features and output labels are used to train the model.
2. A loss function measures the prediction error.
3. The model adjusts its internal parameters (e.g., weights) to minimize the loss.
4. Evaluation is done on validation/test sets to measure generalization.

3. Why Use Supervised Learning?

- 🔍 Clear objectives and measurable accuracy  
- 🧰 Wide range of mature algorithms  
- ⚖️ Applicable to both classification and regression problems  
- 📈 Used in real-world decision systems across industries
