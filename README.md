# INDE577_Machine_Learning_2025_Rice_University

My name is Alex (Yanzhen) Xu, and I am currently a PhD student at the University of Houston. This repository contains code assignments and projects for the course INDE577, Data Science and Machine Learning at Rice University, taught by Dr. Randy Davila. 


In this course, so far, I have studied and implemented:

**SUPERVISED LEARNING:**
- Single neuron model
- Gradient descent
- Single-neuron linear regression
- Single-neuron logistic regression
- Deep neural networks (from scratch)
- K-nearest neighbors
- Decision tree
- Regression tree

All models are implemented using Python, including both classroom code and my own implementations using libraries like TensorFlow and scikit-learn.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to one specific topic or model covered in the course.

Stay tuned as I continue updating this repository with new content!
